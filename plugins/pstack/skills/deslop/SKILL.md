# Remove AI code slop

Check the diff against main and remove AI-generated slop introduced in the branch.

## Focus Areas

- Extra comments that are unnecessary or inconsistent with local style
- Defensive checks or try/catch blocks that are abnormal for trusted code paths
- Casts to `any` used only to bypass type issues
- Deeply nested code that should be simplified with early returns
- Other patterns inconsistent with the file and surrounding codebase

## Guardrails

- Keep behavior unchanged unless fixing a clear bug.
- Prefer minimal, focused edits over broad rewrites.
- Keep the final summary concise (1-3 sentences).

## Codex runtime

On Codex, upstream tool, path, and agent names in this skill map through [codex-tools.md](../poteto-mode/references/codex-tools.md). A `<role model>` placeholder is the role's model resolved by [Codex routing](../poteto-mode/references/codex-routing.md). Where a step here says to omit `model`, run on the parent model, or fall back to another slug after a rejection, the Codex spawn contract wins: resolve the pair or stop before spawning.
