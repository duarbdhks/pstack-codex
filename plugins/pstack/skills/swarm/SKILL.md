# Swarm

## Start

Open a todolist with one entry per phase before launching anything.

1. Frame
2. Fan out
3. Aggregate
4. Report

## Phase A: Frame

1. State the done predicate and the artifact or report the swarm must return.
2. Choose the shape. Partition into slices, race N workers on identical briefs, or mix both. For a race or mixed shape, declare `first pass`, `rank all`, or `best-of` before spawning.
3. Pick the worker model from the `swarm workers` line in `~/.codex/pstack-models.md`. If the rule or that line is missing, use `<role model>`. For `auto` or `inherit-parent`, omit `model` so the workers run on the parent model. If the Task tool rejects a slug, use the default and say so. If it rejects the default, use the closest valid slug of the same family from its error message. For a model race, name each arm's model up front. Pick each subagent's reasoning level and fast or standard speed for the job, per the Subagents section of the **poteto-mode** skill.
4. Give each worker its own writable output when it writes. When workers verify or measure commits, each brief names the exact SHAs. A measurement brief also names the method (sample count, what one sample is, order). The worker records both in its result.

## Phase B: Fan out

Spawn all N workers in one message with `subagent_type: generalPurpose`, `environment: "cloud"`, `run_in_background: true`, and the step 3 model, left unset for `auto` or `inherit-parent`. Use `environment: "local"` only when the worker needs access to something on the user's computer.

When a worker must start from a non-default pushed branch, pass `cloud_base_branch`.

Every brief stands alone. Include the goal, scope, exact slice or race arm, how to verify, and what to report. Reports use `PASS`, `ISSUES`, or `BLOCKED` with evidence. A worker that can prove a defect reports `ISSUES` and lists every issue it can prove, not only the first.

If a worker drops out, proceed with N-1 and note it.

## Phase C: Aggregate

Read the terminal results. Drop a result that does not record the SHAs and method its brief names, and respawn that worker once. After a second miss, record a gap. A gap does not count as a pass. For coverage, every required slice needs a result. For a race, apply the selection rule declared up front. Use first pass, rank all, or best-of. Do not paste raw worker dumps.

## Phase D: Report

Return one consolidated in-chat report with a result table, issue one-liners, gaps or dropouts, and the race rule when used.

## Models

Role defaults, stamped from `plugins/pstack/models.json` (edit there, rerun `tools/generate.mjs`). A matching role line in `~/.codex/pstack-models.md` overrides each at runtime; see `/setup-pstack`.

On Codex, dispatch each role below with the [Codex spawn contract](../poteto-mode/references/codex-tools.md#codex-spawn-contract): `agent_type: "default"`, the role as `task_name`, and the `model` and `reasoning_effort` pair resolved by [Codex routing](../poteto-mode/references/codex-routing.md). An omitted model inherits the parent and is an error.

## Codex runtime

On Codex, upstream tool, path, and agent names in this skill map through [codex-tools.md](../poteto-mode/references/codex-tools.md). A `<role model>` placeholder is the role's model resolved by [Codex routing](../poteto-mode/references/codex-routing.md). Where a step here says to omit `model`, run on the parent model, or fall back to another slug after a rejection, the Codex spawn contract wins: resolve the pair or stop before spawning.
